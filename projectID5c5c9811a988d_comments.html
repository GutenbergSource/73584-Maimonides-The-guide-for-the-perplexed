<HTML><BODY>After the holy books, the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> by the medieval scholar Moses Maimonides (better known as Rambam in Jewish circles) is one of the most important books in Jewish history. Original written in Arabic under the titel <i>dalālat al-ḥā’irīn</i> (دلالة الحائرين), it is better known under its Hebrew title <i>Moreh Nevukhim</i> (מורה נבוכים). This English translation is a compact reissue of an original three volume translation, transliterating all Hebrew words and omitting the numerous footnotes. It still is quite a massive work, with a lot of text on every page.

<p>Since Hebrew has been transliterated, you will find some letters with diacritics. Please follow the standard guidelines for these. 
Some care is needed with the transliteration of (what was in the original) the alef (א or ا) and ayin (ע or ع), for which a forward and backward comma-like symbol are used. Please use ' for the normal apostrophe and ` for the turned apostrophe. Please still use the normal ' for both types single quotation marks.


</p><p>While leaving through the book, I've seen one word still in Hebrew, but there may be more. Just mark these as [**Hebrew] (You may add the transliteration if you like).

</p><p>The scans from which this project is derived are on <a href="https://archive.org/details/guideforperplexe00maim/page/n5">TIA</a>; an <a href="https://archive.org/details/guideforperplexe00maimiala/page/n3">alternative copy</a> is also available. Some of the pages have been scanned a little too bright along the edge, an in those cases, the original or alternate scans may help.

</p><p>Enjoy!
